  ## Usage
 The employee datbase is a simple node interface. Start the application by running the 'node index.js' command. Once you have started the application, you will be presented with a menu of actions which you can take. Choices include viewing all departments, viewing all roles, viewing all employees, adding a department, adding a role, adding an employee, and updating an employee role. Once you make your choice, either you will be presented with the data or you will be asked questions regarding what department you'd like to add, what employee you'd like to add or which employee you'd like to update. Once you are done, you can use the 'Quit' option in the menu to quit.
